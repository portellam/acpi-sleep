## Contents

### ‚ùì 1. Why?

By default, some Linux distributions do not have easy access to toggle which
**Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI)** [<sup>\[1\]</sup>](#1)
devices may wake-up the Host machine; *unlike in Microsoft Windows, there is no*
*easy method to do so.* [<sup>\[2\]</sup>](#2)

**What does *ACPI Sleep* do?** A script to blacklist/whitelist specified devices
and/or device groups from ACPI wake-up of the Host; *easily allow or deny mouse*
*movement, key presses, controller input, etc. from disturbing the sleep of a*
*Host machine.*

### ‚úÖ 3. Host Requirements

- **Operating System (OS):**
  - **Linux.**
  - ***BSD*** *is not supported*.

- `systemd` for system services.

### ‚ùì 4. Usage

#### 4.1. The Command Interface (CLI) or Terminal

To open a CLI or Terminal:

- Open a console emulator (for Debian systems: Konsole).
- **Linux only:** Open an existing console: press `CTRL` + `ALT` + `F2`,
  `F3`, `F4`, `F5`, or `F6`.

  - **To return to the desktop,** press `CTRL` + `ALT` + `F7`.
  - `F1` is reserved for debug output of the Linux kernel.
  - `F7` is reserved for video output of the desktop environment.
  - `F8` and above are unused.

#### 4.2. Verify Installer is Executable

1. Go to the directory where the cloned/extracted repository folder is:
   `cd name_of_parent_folder/acpi-sleep/`

2. Make the installer script file executable: `chmod +x installer.bash`

   - Do **not** make any other script files executable. The installer will
    perform this action.
   - Do **not** make any non-script file executable. This is not necessary and
     potentially dangerous.

#### 4.3. `installer.bash`

- **To install,** execute from within the project folder:
  `sudo bash installer.bash`

```
  -h, --help        Print this help and exit.
  -u, --uninstall   Uninstall all source files from system, and remove related
                    startup services.
```

#### 4.4. `acpi-sleep`

- From any folder execute: `sudo acpi-sleep [OPTION]`
  - The CLI's shell (bash) should recognize that the script file is located in
    `/usr/local/bin`.

```
  -h, --help              Print this help and exit.

  -s, --save              Save changes so they persist after restart of the Host
                          machine.

  -b, --blacklist MATCH   Blacklist individual devices and/or PCI devices
                          manually.
                          MATCH is a comma delimited list of keywords, PCI device
                          IDs, and/or IOMMU groups (groups of PCI devices).
                          Keywords include individual or PCI device names and
                          types; PCI device IDs are colon delimited pairs of
                          four-character alphanumeric words; IOMMU groups are
                          positive numbers.

  --blacklist-all         Blacklist all individual devices and PCI devices.

  --blacklist-kbm         Blacklist all individual keyboard-and-mouse (KBM)
                          devices.

  --blacklist-pci         Blacklist all PCI device groups.

  --blacklist-usb         Blacklist all individual USB devices and USB PCI devices
                          (USB controllers).

  --blacklist-non-kbm     Blacklist all individual non-KBM devices.

  -w, --whitelist MATCH   Whitelist individual devices and/or PCI devices
                          manually.
                          MATCH is a comma delimited list of keywords, PCI device
                          IDs, and/or IOMMU groups (groups of PCI devices).
                          Keywords include individual or PCI device names and
                          types; PCI device IDs are colon delimited pairs of
                          four-character alphanumeric words; IOMMU groups are
                          positive numbers.

  --whitelist-all         Whitelist all individual devices and PCI devices.

  --whitelist-kbm         Whitelist all individual keyboard-and-mouse (KBM)
                          devices.

  --whitelist-pci         Whitelist all PCI device groups.

  --whitelist-usb         Whitelist all individual USB devices and USB PCI devices
                          (USB controllers).

  --whitelist-non-kbm     Whitelist all individual non-KBM devices.
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è 5. Disclaimer
Default behavior of a Host machine is to allow system wake-up by USB. Therefore,
installing *ACPI Sleep* to enable wake-up of devices, *is not necessary.*

**Should your system not have...**
- a Power button.
- Wake-on-LAN (with an active Network connection).
- scheduled wake-up times.
- Remote administration.
- etc.

*...then this script may prevent system resume. Please evaluate your system*
*before installation.*
